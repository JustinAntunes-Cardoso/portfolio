## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating clean, efficient code and user-friendly applications. I graduated from BrainStation's Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp and have experience working with a range of technologies and programming languages, including:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Python
- React
- Jest.js
- Node.js
- Express
- Knex.js
- MySQL

I believe that good communication, attention to detail, and a focus on user experience are key to building successful projects. I love collaborating with clients and teammates to find innovative solutions to complex problems.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball, practicing bass guitar, or exploring the great outdoors.

## Projects

# BrainHive
BrainHive is a spelling bee app designed to help students of all ages improve their spelling skills. The app features a range of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced, and includes over 10,000 words in its database. Users can track their progress and see who has the best spelling skills.

The app was built using React and Node.js, with a MySQL database for storing user data. I used responsive design to ensure that the app looks great on any device, from desktop computers to smartphones.

# SEBA
SEBA is a website for a rep team basketball organization. The website includes information about the team, its schedule, and its players, as well as news and updates about upcoming games and events.

The site was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a backend database to store the stats of the players. We worked closely with the team's coaches and administrators to ensure that the site met their needs and reflected the organization's brand and values.

# KTC
KTC is a therapy company that provides a range of services, including counseling, therapy, and coaching. The website was designed to be a welcoming and informative resource for potential clients, with information about the company's services, staff, and philosophy.

The site was built using WordPress, with a custom theme designed to match the company's branding. We worked closely with the company's staff to ensure that the site accurately reflected their values and approach to therapy, and included clear calls-to-action to encourage visitors to reach out for more information.
